Comparison Between MSSQL Server and PostgressSQL

IN terms of DML commands Postgress has a extra command which is 

SET search_path TO DBNAME;

Which si similar to MSSQL where it is  USE DBNAME;


In postgress Creating a database is quite different in compare to Postgres
1 In postgress we need to assign the owner name 
2 Need to assign the Encoding type
3 And also connection limit where -1 means unlimited

In postgress Schema name is given before each table name

In postgress there is no support for NVARCHAR data type where as in MSSQL it supports. NVARCHAR basically stores each char as 2 bytes and can be used to store Unicode data.
